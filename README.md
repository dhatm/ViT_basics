# ViT_basics
Explores vision transformer basics, including using pretrained models, finetuning, etc.

## notebooks
1. vit_load_n_eval_google_model.ipynb -- loads google's pretrained vision transformer model and evaluates performance on microsoft/kaggle's cats and dogs dataset, and also on a set of family & friend cat and dog photos
2. vit_finetuning_on_my_dataset.ipynb -- finetunes google's pretrained vision transformer model
3. vit_load_n_eval_finetuned_model.ipynb -- loads finetuned model (from notebook #2) and evaluates performance on microsoft/kaggle's cats and dogs dataset, and also on a set of family & friend cat and dog photos
